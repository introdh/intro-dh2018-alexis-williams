# Digital
Over the summer, I came into contact with the song "Broken" by the Lovely Band, and it is now one of my favorite songs. I think it's an interesting take on a modern romance. [Broken by the Lovely Band](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=broken+the+lovely+band+lyrics)

I also came into contact with a picture of the Northern Lights from NASA, and it was gorgeous. ![alt text](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1806/IMG_5938Mauduit_2048.jpg)
