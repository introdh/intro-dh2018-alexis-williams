#### Enhancing the Humanities
  For my project, I would like to use spatial mapping to give a visual representation of where the use of child labor is taking place, all throughout Mexico between the years of 2000-2018. I would also like to use networks to give a visual representation to connections between various factories and the factory owners where child labor was found to have been used. Mexico is a great place to start simply because in the United States, the laws created forbidding child labor are enforced strictly, whereas in Mexico, these laws have been created, but have not been enforced as thoroughly. Many children, as many as 882,000 between ages 5-13, have slipped through the cracks. To make matters worse, these children are legally employed, and nothing is being done. The main goal for this project is to raise awareness about this problem, which is occuring all over the world. A secondary goal, after raising awareness, is that the awareness created by this project will lead to change. Whether it be the United States interfering to help, or Mexico more strictly enforcing its child labor laws, my hope is that change will occur and children can be protected.
#### Environmental Scan
  For my project, I would like to draw on many different features from a few different digital projects. One of these projects being *Photogrammar*, because I like the timeline feature on the map. Since my data will be tracking the number of factories convicted of using child labor over 18 years, I would like to be able to use a program that would allow me to physically show that data changing. The timeline feature would be perfect to do so, as a user can drag the timeline to a specific timeframe or specific year, and see which factories were convicted that specific year.
  Another project I would like to draw off of is *American Panorama*, which used mapping data, and had an interesting feature where users had the ability to click on specific points and information about the selected point woul appear. I would like to use this feature on my own map. ON my map specifically, the "points" would be factories, and users would be able to select any point of their chosing, which would cause an information box to appear. This information box would include an image of the factory, the date it was found to be using child labor, who the owner was at that time, a description of the product produced and sold there, and the number of child laborers found working at the factory.
  After being shown a tutorial on how to use the map, users would be given free reign on the site I created. One tab will say "Spatial Map" and another tab will say "Network". Under the "Network" tab, those same factories (or points on the map) would be shown in a network. Each edge would be idicative of relation between the two nodes its connecting. For example, if one owner has owned three different factories that were found to use child labor, all three of those nodes would be connected to the same "owner" node. If one of owner one's factories was also owned by owner three, then that factory would have two edges coming frmo it, connecting it to owner one and to owner three. Using the network will allow users to draw more conclusions about owners and factories and see if there are any outstanding communities created.
#### History of the Project
  Child labor had been occuring as early as the 19th century, due to Industrialization. In the United States, there have been strict laws enacted to prevent the use of child labor in the United States. However, our neighbor at the border, Mexico, has done little to protect the children. There are laws against the use of child labor, but those laws are very rarely enforced. This project is the first of its kind, attempting to combat child labor through technological means. Using technology to physically show people just how often this henious offense is occuring, and just how close it is to the United States. Also, using techology makes it more accessible to the public, so that there is growing awareness, and hopefully change someday.
#### Work Plan
  As a level II grant, I will be requesting $100,000 to support this project. I would like to use up to $70,000 building my website, plus paying for the resources needed to create the computer program for the network, plus paying for the actual creation of the network and spatial map previously described. I would also use that $80,000 to pay my programmers and those who contribute to the creation of my website. I think a reasonable timeframe for the creation of my website is two months; once those two months are finished and my site is open to the public, I will be paying my programmers $10,000 each for their work.
  With the remaining $30,000, I would like to actually expand my project to create a network of Mexico-made products produced in factories that have used child labor, that are then sold in the United States.
