## Participants
  My lead programmer on this project is going to be Ethan Marcotte. He specializes in web pages "beyond just the desktop", which is what I'm looking for. I want my website to make people think and to intrigue and to encourage people to look further in the topic of child labor, and I think Ethan could help me do that.
  The second programmer I would like to employ to work on my grant's website is Chris Coyier, who specializes in Cascade Styling Sheet programming. Also known as CSS programming, this type of programming is responsible for the actual design of the site; like the color scheme, the layout, and visual effects. In my opinion, hiring Chris would allow for the best outcome when it comes to the beauty and elegance of my website.
  I, of course, would be acting as a supervisor, or director. I would be responsible for making sure the project is finished in a timely manner, along with making sure that there are enough funds to completely pay for my project. As director, I would be supervising Ethan and Chris, making sure every detail of my site is exactly how I'd like it to be.
## Narrative
#### Enhancing the Humanities
  I think the best way to begin this project is with a spatial map, which would give my audience an idea of the physical locations I am describing. Using GPS coordinates, I would plug them into a program that would physically mark the location on a map. This spatial map will be the base for my whole project.
  Also, using a networking program, like RStudio, to create a network, which would allow me to show the connections between the various GPS locations marked by the spatial map. For this specific network, I would connect factories by ownership.
  
#### Environmental Scan
  For my project, I would like to draw on many different features from a few different digital projects. One of these projects being *Photogrammar*, because I like the timeline feature on the map. Since my data will be tracking the number of factories convicted of using child labor over 18 years, I would like to be able to use a program that would allow me to physically show that data changing. The timeline feature would be perfect to do so, as a user can drag the timeline to a specific timeframe or specific year, and see which factories were convicted that specific year.
  Another project I would like to draw off of is *American Panorama*, which used mapping data, and had an interesting feature where users had the ability to click on specific points and information about the selected point would appear. I would like to use this feature on my own map. On my map specifically, the "points" would be factories, and users would be able to select any point of their choosing, which would cause an information box to appear. This information box would include an image of the factory, the date it was found to be using child labor, who the owner was at that time, a description of the product produced and sold there, and the number of child laborers found working at the factory.
  After being shown a tutorial on how to use the map, users would be given free reign on the site I created. One tab will say "Spatial Map" and another tab will say "Network". Under the "Network" tab, those same factories (or points on the map) would be shown in a network. Each edge would be indicative of relation between the two nodes its connecting. For example, if one owner has owned three different factories that were found to use child labor, all three of those nodes would be connected to the same "owner" node. If one of owner one's factories was also owned by owner three, then that factory would have two edges coming from it, connecting it to owner one and to owner three. Using the network will allow users to draw more conclusions about owners and factories and see if there are any outstanding communities created.
  This project is important for a variety of reasons. The most important reason being because young children are not able to consent to dangerous work, especially work in factories. Children are losing their lives due to unsafe working conditions, and there is nothing being done to fight for the rights of the children. Also, this project is important because it will raise awareness. This project would expose the public to the truth about child labor, and that even though it is not a pressing matter in America, it is a problem for those just over the border.
#### History of the Project
  Child labor had been occurring as early as the 19th century, due to Industrialization. In the United States, there have been strict laws enacted to prevent the use of child labor. However, our neighbor at the border, Mexico, has done little to protect the children. Mexico is a great place to start this project simply because in the United States, the laws created forbidding child labor are enforced strictly, whereas in Mexico, these laws have been created, but have not been enforced as thoroughly. Many children, as many as 882,000 between ages 5-13, have slipped through the cracks. To make matters worse, these children are legally employed, and nothing is being done. The main goal for this project is to raise awareness about this problem, which is occurring all over the world. A secondary goal, after raising awareness, is that the awareness created by this project will lead to change. Whether it be the United States interfering to help, or Mexico more strictly enforcing its child labor laws, my hope is that change will occur, and children can be protected. This project is the first of its kind, attempting to combat child labor through technological means. Using technology to physically show people just how often this heinous offense is occurring, and just how close it is to the United States. Also, using technology makes it more accessible to the public, so that there is growing awareness, and hopefully change someday.
#### Work Plan
  As a level II grant, I will be requesting $100,000 to support this project. I would like to use up to $70,000 building my website, plus paying for the resources needed to create the computer program for the network, plus paying for the actual creation of the network and spatial map previously described. I would also use that $80,000 to pay my programmers (Ethan Marcotte) and those who contribute to the creation of my website. I think a reasonable time frame for the creation of my website is two months; once those two months are finished and my site is open to the public, I will be paying my programmers $10,000 each for their work.
  With the remaining $30,000, I would like to actually expand my project to create a network of Mexico-made products produced in factories that have used child labor, that are then sold in the United States. I would like to create a network of where each of the products are sold. For example, if a popular store in America is buying goods from factories known to use child labor, a network could make that obvious. The amount of edges from the one store to the next would allow users to see just how much the United States contributes to the child labor problems in Mexico.
  Ethan will specifically be responsible for
