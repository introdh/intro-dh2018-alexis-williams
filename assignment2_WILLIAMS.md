## My Network
For my network, I chose to use three different sets of cases. I chose 10090, self-incrimination (other than Miranda); 10100, Miranda warnings; and 10110, self-incrimination. I felt that choosing these three would give me enough overlap to draw conclusions about case relations, but also provide enough differences that there would be room for discussion as to why those differences may occur. I thought that using both self-incrimination with and without Miranda allowed me to draw conclusions about the impact of Miranda rights on the decision of the justices (was there a difference between votes?).
## Questions Answered or Arguments Generated
My data seems to answer questions like "when were self-incrimination cases popular?" and "are there any connections between Miranda rights cases and self-incrimination cases?" There is also an established connection between self-incrimination with and without Miranda rights. My network also shows that during the 1950s and 1960s, self-incrimination cases (with and without Miranda) were rather popular. This could occur due to Miranda v. the United States, the case that set the precedent for the Miranda warnings occurring in the 1960s.
When I was running progrmas through R, I noticed that there were not very made red nodes when I ran the "gatekeeper" program, which made me think that there were not very many different "communities"; however, there were 16 different clusters, which made me draw the conclusions that there were many different communities that were connected by a common "gatekeeper". 
## Network Analysis Pros and Cons
Personally, I like the use of networks to make connections and draw conclusions in regards to two or more topics. However, I do believe that this can become very cluttered if the topics are very broad. My network, using three somewhat specific topics, was still too cluttered for my personal liking; however, it is legible and can be interpreted rather easily.
As Scott Weingart said, these networks could one day be used to do geographically map different things, like letters, or like Josua Catalano used networks, tracking the geographic migration of Native American tribes in the 1800's.
One major setback for networks; however, is that you must be certain that the networks you are using have some sort of overlap, in order to provide an interesting analysis. If the topics are two different, there could be a lack of overlap, making for a weak analysis.
