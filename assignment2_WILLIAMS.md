## My Network
For my network, I chose to use three different sets of cases. I chose 10090, self-incrimination (other than Miranda); 10100, Miranda warnings; and 10110, self-incrimination. I felt that choosing these three would give me enough overlap to draw conclusions about case relations, but also provide enough differences that there would be room for discussion as to why those differences may occur.
## Questions Answered or Arguments Generated
My data seems to answer questions like "when were self-incrimination cases popular?" and "are there any connections between Miranda rights cases and self-incrimination cases?" There is also an established connection between self-incrimination with and without Miranda rights.
## Network Analysis Pros and Cons
Personally, I like the use of networks to make connections and draw conclusuons in regards to two or more topics. However, I do believe that this can become very cluttered if the topics are very broad. My network, using three somewhat specific topics, was still too cluttered for my personal liking; however, it is legible and can be interpretted rather easily.
As Scott Weingart said, these networks could one day be used to do geographically map different things, like letters, or geographic migration of Native American tribes in the 1800's (Catalano).
