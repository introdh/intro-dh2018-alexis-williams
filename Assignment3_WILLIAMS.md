## The Process
For this assignment, I kept track of my travels every hour for a week. I pinpointed my location via latitiude and longitude coordinates. If I happened to be in more than one place within an hour, I chose the place that I spent the most time at, unless there was a specific, important reason for another place. Putting the map itself together was fairly simple, and it was interesting to see just how many places I traveled in one short week.
## Challenges of Representing Space and Place
As discussed by Bodenhamer, it is difficult to display such "geographic comeplexity" onto a map based solely of "entities, fields, objects, attributes, and geometric topology" because it "contrasts with the humanities emphasis on ambiguity, complexity, nuance and plurarlity" (Bodenhamer, Springer, 2013). Also, as previously mentioned, maps can be ambiguous, so without background knowledge on a topic, the person viewing the map can become confused. I think the best way to prevent this ambiguity is to include a thorough legend, and incorporate descriptions, like on the ArcGIS Online map I created.
## Limits and Possibilities
A major limit of mapping and spatial analysis is the inability to convey feeling and emotion. Maps are solely objective, showing places, rather than spaces. Background knowledge and legends help convey emotion to an audience, however, so not all is lost.
In the future it would be interesting to see tangible 3-D maps. Or maps that have audio attached, similar to maps you see in a museum, only hand-held and transportable.
